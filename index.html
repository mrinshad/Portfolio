                        I am a devoloper with experience in both Android and web devolopment.
                        After completing my diploma in Computer Engineering, I joined Wizzo Technologies as an Android
                        and
                        web devoloper.
                        During my time at Wizzo, I gained valuable experience working with a team to create mobile and
                        web
                        applications that were both user-friendly and productive.<br><br>

                        At Wizzo Technologies, I was responsible for designing and developing front-end and back-end for
                        Android and
                        web applications. I worked closely with other developers to ensure that the applications were
                        functional and
                        met the needs of the end-users. My work at Wizzo helped me to develop my technical skills and
                        taught
                        me
                        the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving project goals.<br><br>

                        After a few months at Wizzo, I decided to further my education by joining an engineering college
                        to
                        obtain my degree. Throughout my education, I continued to hone my skills in design and
                        development,
                        staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. <br><br>

                        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new ideas and techniques, and experimenting with different
                        tools and software. I believe that my experience and education make me a valuable asset to any
                        project, and I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
